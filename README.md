### FAILURE DETECTION by Predictive Models: SVM, Random Forest, Xgboost, Decision Trees and TensorFlow API
Data Science Research Project

#### The Data:
#### 1.	This data represents a technology which is in a remote location. It sends data periodically on its status â€“ failure or not. It is #### very expensive to fix these machines because they are in remote areas and its failure is hard to predict. It is your job as the #### researcher to help us predict failures which may occur in the future
#### 2.	Historical file : predict_failure.csv

#### The Task
#### 1.	Research : Please create a predictive model using a jupyter notebook with the python 3 language.
#### a.	Highlight your thought process in the notebook as you explore the data
#### b.	Showcase your best predictive model
#### c.	Evaluate your model
#### d.	Please only show relevant items in the notebook
#### e.	Please additionally provide a PDF file from the notebook
#### 2.	Coding : Please package your best model into one class (or more) that will
#### a.	Train the model using the data provided
#### b.	Make predictions on a similar CSV input file
#### c.	Return the entered CSV file with probability of failure column appended. 
#### d.	Also
#### i.	Provide your dependencies 
#### ii.	If using anaconda please provide conda yml file
#### iii.	If using virtual env please provide requirements.txt
